        <section class="About">
            <p>I am a full-stack engineer and I spend most of my time contributing to open-source projects and exploring crypto research. Currently, I am deeply invested in learning Web3 and cryptography.</p>
            <p>Professors, chai, and Good-Day biscuits will make me deliver 100x outputs to your lab.</p>
            <p>My two biggest itches right now:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Joining a startup where I can do the best work of my life with a team that will be remembered for decades.</li>
                <li>I'm really into the idea of joining a AI lab.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Prior to all of this, I was a <a href="https://engineering.jhu.edu/admissions/graduate-admissions/heep/">HEEP Fellow</a> during the summer of 2024 at <span class="jhu-trigger">Johns Hopkins University</span>. After that, I worked as a senior undergraduate research scholar in the Department of <a href="https://engineering.jhu.edu/case/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CASE</a>, collaborating with the Optimal Lab under the supervision of <a href="https://systems.jhu.edu/kimia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Kimia Ghobadi</a>.</p>
            <p>If you think there's an opportunity where I could be a good fit, feel free to use the "Book a Meeting" button on my website or reach out to me via email â€” I'd be more than happy to connect.</p>
