    <section class="About">
        <p>I was born and raised in India, but I moved to America at 21 for work and education. It still feels surreal, unbelievable and crazy that someone actually flew me out to work in the states. Since then, I've had the chance to visit some incredible places, and one of the most memorable was New York City. I took <span class="nyc-photos-trigger">amazing photos during my visit</span>, and ever since, I've felt that spending my twenties in New York would be an incredible experience.</p>
        <p>To keep track of my journey towards this goal, I've created a progress bar below.</p>

        <p>Some of my favorite shots from New York City - the energy, the architecture, and the dreams. First image is taken during the Roosevelt Island ferry ride, and the second one is a view of Lower Manhattan skyline.</p>
